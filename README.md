## How I Made It üî® <a name="how-i-made-it">

### Technology Stack <a name="tech-stack">
- Unity Editor (Version 2022.3.28f)
- Microsoft Visual Studio (Version 17.9.6)
- Microsoft .NET Framework (Version 4.8.09037)
- C# (version 7.3)
- Amazon Q Developer
- AWS GameLift: Used to manage multiplayer sessions and real-time communication between players.
- AWS Lambda: Handles matchmaking and game session management.
- AWS Cognito: Provides secure authentication and temporary credentials for players.
- ChatGPT API: Powers dynamic riddle generation, ensuring each game session offers a new challenge.

### Features <a name="features">
#### Goal
I participated in the AWS Game Builder Challenge, where the goal was to build a game using AWS services. As a beginner with AWS, I initially struggled with deciding what to create. After coming up with 5 ideas, I eventually chose Escape Solstara as the winning idea. 

I wanted to create a multiplayer game that was as competitive and exhilirating as many other popular multiplayer games-Fortnite for example-but with more of a brain-teasing element. The result is Escape Solstara, a scavenger hunt game set in a medieval city, where players must decipher riddles and uncover hidden artifacts to escape.

#### Dynamic Riddle Generation

To ensure that each game session felt fresh and unpredictable, I wanted the riddles to be dynamically generated rather than prewritten. Manually writing riddles for hundreds of possible artifacts (objects the player must find to reveal the next clue) would have been both time-consuming and limiting, so I went with the next best thing that's capable of generating content quickly, generative AI. 

I used ChatGPT-4o to generate riddles based on the name of the artifact and its location in the city. I added descriptions for each area of the city, allowing the model to generate more clever riddles for the player to solve. 

The artifacts are assigned at random for each player, in each game session. When all players have entered the lobby the artifacts are loaded and ChatGPT generates riddles for each one.
